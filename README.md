### Abstract ###
	
	Outdoor smart spaces are equipped with various electronic devices—smart
	sensors, cameras, charging stations, IoT devices, and interactive displays—that
	are distributed widely throughout the area. Using the power grid or batteries to
	power all these devices is not a scalable option. One promising solution is to use
	renewable energy such as solar energy harvesting to power such devices. In
	order to achieve this, we propose to generate a harvesting map of a given space
	to evaluate the harvesting potential of the space and identify locations for solar
	panel installations, charging stations, etc. We have analyzed shadow effects from
	buildings, clouds and the path of the sun. This project provides information on
	potential solar energy outdoor points of interest, such as outdoor café sitting
	areas and outdoor social settings on the UC Irvine campus map. As a result of
	this process, students not only can see an estimate of the current day’s solar
	energy but also get sun and shadow data for locations throughout the campus.
	We have developed a software framework at both server and mobile platform
	levels to demonstrate the solar energy map while considering shadow effects
	from buildings and clouds.
